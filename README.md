VIDA
====
VIDA (or virtual identity for disaster response) is set of applications to assist responders in documenting and tracking lost, injured, and displaced people in a disaster. This will provide the ability for responders and shelter managers to know what shelters or camps people have been moved to and therefore assist both in the logistics of managing the response effort, and in the reunification of families. 

VIDA consists of a web and mobile application. The mobile app allows for responders to record information about individuals, take a photo, and scan a barcode (such as those on wristbands). The web client and server will provide a searchable database to find and locate people, and update records. It will also provide summary information about the shelter itself to help the shelter managers understand the current state of the facility. In addition, the web application will provide the ability to do face matching from photos (using OpenBR - openbiometrics.org).
